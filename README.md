Hospital price transparency helps Americans know the cost of a hospital item or service before receiving it. Starting January 1, 2021, each hospital operating in the United States will be required to provide clear, accessible pricing information online about the items and services they provide in two ways:

As a comprehensive machine-readable file with all items and services.
In a display of shoppable services in a consumer-friendly format.
This information will make it easier for consumers to shop and compare prices across hospitals and estimate the cost of care before going to the hospital.

CMS plans to audit a sample of hospitals for compliance starting in January, in addition to investigating complaints that are submitted to CMS and reviewing analyses of non-compliance, and hospitals may face civil monetary penalties for noncompliance. Access a list of hospitals that have been issued CMPs.



Most institutions in the United States that are licensed as hospitals or otherwise approved as meeting applicable licensing requirements must post their standard charges prominently on a publicly available website.
For additional details on the definition of hospital refer to 45 CFR ยง180.20 and on the federally owned or operated hospitals already deemed to be in compliance refer to 45 CFR ยง180.30.
